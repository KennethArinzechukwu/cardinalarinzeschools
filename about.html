                    </div>
                        <p> Br. Charles Okeke, Superior General 2009 – 2015, had intended to open a befitting Secondary School for the Congregation of the Brothers of St. Stephen but before he could do that he thought it was wise to open a pre-secondary first from which the graduates will be admitted to secondary, hence the founding of St. Stephen’s Nursery and Primary.
                            In December 2013, at the general meeting of the Brothers at Nkwelle – Ezunaka, Br. Charles Okeke with the consent of his councilors constituted a vibrant committee with the mandate to fence the novitiate compound and later a mandate to open a Secondary school was included. Br. Patrick Okaka the then project manager was made the chairman of the committee. Other members included: Br. Samuel Obijuru, Br. Benedict Azebeokhai, Br. Joseph Onyekonwu, Br. Martin Ukanwa, and Br. Emeka Maduka. The committee later coopted magistrate Ngozi Okoye and Rev. Fr. Theophilus Odukwe as members. The committee worked assiduously to see that the objective was achieved, and it was achieved.
                            In August 2014, the committee with the consent of the Superior General organized a luncheon for Francis Cardinal Arinze and his friends as well as friends of the Brothers at the residence of Cardinal Arinze, the founder of the Brothers of St. Stephen. Some invited guests turned up and donated generously after listening to the address read by the Superior General. Senator Victor Umeh made a donation of five Million Naira (#5m) plus pledges and cash donations by other philanthropists present. With the money realized, the novitiate compound was fenced, and then foundation was started for Secondary School. Later in the year, the then governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, attended an event at the novitiate, same day with Francis Cardinal Arinze, a ground breaking ceremony for the secondary school was made. By July 2015, first floor of the building had been decked and work was going on progressively.
                            <br>
                            The school founded by Br. Charles Okeke in 2013/2014, took off during the administration of Br. Pantaleon Okafor on the 19th September 2016 with twelve (12) students and six (6) teachers with a Mass celebrated by His Eminence Francis Cardinal Arinze. The pioneer principal remains Mr. Charles Onwuagana who was also present at the opening Mass together with the brothers. At the Mass His Eminence Francis Cardinal Arinze commissioned both the staff and  students to swing into action towards achieving excellence in all spheres of life: academically, socially, morally, mentally, and otherwise. Since then the school has not left any stone unturned to achieve the desired result.
                           Thanks to God, the school which began with 12 students and six teachers in 2016, had risen to 439 students and 34 staff  in 2022/2023 academic session.
                           The principal remains Mr. Charles Onwuagana, who is being assisted by two vice principals: vice administration and vice academics, and other principal officers like the Dean of studies.

There is a strong culture of acceptance of difference, and extensive support for the individual needs of students. The School has a very well-qualified and stable staff, and there is a strong commitment to investing in the professional development of teachers. We always aim to recruit staff that are passionate about teaching and learning. <br /><br />We have a dedicated team of both teaching and support staff, who ensure that our children enjoy a happy and caring educational experience within a secure, stimulating and purposeful environment. The expertise and experience of the Senior Leadership Team contributes greatly to the consistent strength of the school. The international staff reflect truly international flavor to the education provided and this permeates the curricular and co-curricular programmes offered. <br /><br />The facilities are very good, and meet the academic, technological and social requirements of our students. Within the school we have well equipped classrooms, which are bright and spacious. We have interactive smart boards, a separate library, an ICT suite and several small group-working areas. CDMIS is frequently oversubscribed. Parents are more and more often obliged to go to appeal to gain a place for their child. <br /><br />The school is fortunate in having a strong and experienced Governing Board who share in the staff&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the long and short-term success of the school. They take an active part in school life as well as ensuring that the school remains a safe environment for all children to reach their full potential.</p> -->

The school later got approval and exam number to write the Basic Examination Certificate (BECE) in the school in 2019. The first BECE was written in the school and the student’s scored 100% passes.
    The management later proceeded to getting approval for senior secondary school. It was a success made by the then chairman of Education /Mission who doubled as manager, Br. Samuel Obijuru.
    On 3rd September 2021, Br Charles Okeke came in as re – elected Superior General. He paved the way for a successful approval for West African Examination (that is, senior secondary certificate exam SSCE) and National Examination Certificate (NECO) and their examination numbers respectively from the Anambra State Ministry of Education. The approval for these external exams speak loud of the school as in the first SSCE and NECO exams the students recorded 100% passes just as in BECE, 2019.
